    <h4>Description of Education 3.0 Courses</h4>
    <h5>The Process</h5>
    <p>No formal lectures. The professor in charge assigns the topic each week. The professor provides pre-recorded lectures and reference materials via Internet. Students learn by listening to pre-recorded lectures delivered by the KAIST Education 3.0 professors, from reference materials available on the Internet, and by performing simple experiments.</p>
    <p>Students communicate with the Education 3.0 Consulting Professors in other countries through the Internet and Skype when they have questions on the lecture materials. Students consult with the local KAIST faculty when they have questions after listening the pre-recorded lectures. Students formally get together with the faculty advisor and fellow students once a week to review what they have done.</p>
    <h5>Benefits of Edu 3.0</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Freedom in Learning – Students are no longer bound by a time and place for learning</li>
        <li>Globalized Learning – Students are able to interact and have discussions with students from all over the world.</li>
        <li>Small Group Learning – Discussions in small groups is said to be the best way of learning!</li>
        <li>Integrated and Interactive Learning – No more traditional lectures. Learn through activities and interaction with your peers, TAs and professors.</li>
    </ul>
        <br>
    <h4>Transferring Credits</h4>
    <p>A student's home university is mainly responsible for transferring KAIST academic credits. KAIST only provides information on the grading system, course syllabus, and the academic policy of the KISS. Therefore, you are advised to consult with the appropriate academic authorities at your home institution in advance using our course syllabus posted online.</p>
